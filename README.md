# Graphics Engine

This repository hosts a simple, configurable graphics engine using SDL and OpenGL.  The program accepts .obj files with traingulated meshes, and can be used to render simple 3D compositions of those objects with a moveable camera and lighting.  Currently implementing the functionality to read in JSON files with time stepped physics updates to render motion.
